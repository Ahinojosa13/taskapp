# taskapp
During a one of days on which I stayed back we learned about CRUD and based off the lesson i applied the little knowledge that i learned and sudo coded my project to have an easy check list when coding out my steps. I would say that getting my road talk on Arrays was a good thing since I also include push and splice methods in my array of task. 
Hardship: 
- I had orginally found a video where it made that task manager but not using node just basic javascript and i was trying to convert that code into node.js format but it was a real headache
